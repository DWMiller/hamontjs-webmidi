# web-midi-talk-2019-08-22

This sample project is a demo for the #hamontjs meetup in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  

It is meant to be used with real MIDI hardware, in this case a drum machine (Arturia Drumbrute Impact) and a synthesizer (Arturia Microfreak). Any two (or even one) MIDI device(s) should work, but your results may vary :)

You can find MIDI mappings for the drum machine in `config/drumMap.js`. The keys will need to correspond to those returned from the `drumbot` endpoint, and the values will correspond to those on the destination hardware. 

Most of the logic lives in `Master.vue` for now. It will get moved into smaller ocmponents in the future. 

> This is definitely a work in progress, so PRs are welcome. 

## Known Issues

- Playing while something is already playing will just playing overtop 
- Need to hit play twice after first play, and every subsequent play
